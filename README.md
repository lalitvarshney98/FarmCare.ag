This repository consists of files required for end to end implementation and deployment of Deep Learning Cotton Disease Classification web application created with flask and deployed on the local system.
## About the App
The Cotton Disease Predictor is a flask web application which classifies a cotton plant/leaf real time image into four categories viz. diseased cotton leaf, diseased cotton plant, fresh cotton leaf, and fresh cotton plant. The code is written in Python 3.6.10 and makes use of Keras and Tensorflow libraries in developing an InceptionV3 based image classification web application.
